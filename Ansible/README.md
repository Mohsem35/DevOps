Ansible has stored all necessary modules and YAML template for build a play book.
You can find it by below cmds.

```
$ ansible-doc -l | grep ufw
$ ansible-doc community.general.system.ufw
```

Currently it has 7275 modules.
So, no need to memorized any module's config file... :slightly_smiling_face:
