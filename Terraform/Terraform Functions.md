### More Terraform Functions

Terraform Console is an **interactive command-line interface tool** provided by Terraform, an infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. The Terraform Console allows you to **evaluate expressions in the context of your Terraform configuration**, which can be helpful for testing and debugging.


```shell
terraform console
```

**`Numeric fucntions`** is used to transform and manipulate **numbers**

**`String fucntions`** is used to transform and manipulate **string type data**

**`Collection fucntions`** are used for collection data types such as set, list and map


### Operators & Conditional Expressions

- Numeric operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Equality operators: `==`, `!=`
- Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `=` 
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`


we can certainly use **if**, **else** conditional expression

condition ? true_val : false_val
