### Remote State and State Locking


**Remote State:** Remote state refers to **storing Terraform's state files in a remote location** rather than locally on the machine where Terraform commands are run. Storing state remotely is beneficial for collaboration among team members and for maintaining consistency across multiple environments. When you use remote state, Terraform stores information such as resource IDs, metadata, and dependencies in a backend storage system, such as Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, or a Terraform Enterprise instance.


**State Locking:** State locking is a mechanism used to **prevent concurrent modifications to Terraform state**. When multiple users or automation processes are working with the same Terraform configuration, there is a risk of concurrent state modifications, which can lead to conflicts, corruption, or loss of data. State locking prevents these issues by locking the state file when a Terraform operation is initiated, such as terraform apply or terraform destroy.

State locking typically **involves acquiring a lock on the remote state file** before performing any modifications and releasing the lock once the operation is complete. This prevents other users or processes from modifying the state file simultaneously. If a lock cannot be acquired, Terraform will wait for a specified timeout period before exiting with an error, ensuring that only one process can modify the state at a time.
