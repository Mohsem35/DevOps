//what is callback function?
// A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some specific task is completed. 
// The primary purpose of using a callback function is to allow asynchronous or non-blocking operations to be performed in a program.

// When a function takes a callback function as an argument, it can execute the callback function at any time, 
// including after the main function has returned. This allows the program to perform other tasks while the main function is still running, 
// and the callback function can be executed when the task it is waiting for is completed.
